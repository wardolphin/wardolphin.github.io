I am Brianna I am the Dream Seer


I witness your dreams


More than you can ever believe, I believe on your behalf.

Tell me your dreams, I live to hear them. 

What lives deep down inside you? What is the tiny spark that yearns to be fanned into a raging blaze?

My dreams command the utmost respect, for they are me. Your dreams deserve the light of witnessing. Come forth and let them SHINE.

## FAQ

### What if I don't have any dreams?

Take a deep breath. You just haven't practiced. Ask yourself this question: If I had all the money in the world, and no external responsibilities, what would I like to do?

Close your eyes, and let something come to mind. 

### What if I have LOTS of dreams?

Please tell me as many as you feel comfortable.
